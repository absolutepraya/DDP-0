DDP-0 (Fundamentals of Programming 0) is an initiative by the [Faculty of Computer Science UI 2022](https://www.instagram.com/anak_apollo/) aimed specifically at new students of the Faculty of Computer Science UI 2023 who are eager to learn the basic concepts and principles of programming. The follwings are the problems from the program.

I am asked to help Dek Depe, a new student at Faculty of CompSci UI, create a Python program to generate customizable name tags. The program should be able to take input data and sizes for the name tags and calculate the printing costs based on the provided paper cost of Rp100/cm^2.

In the updated version of the Python program for Dek Depe, it now processes multiple name tags based on the input quantity. For instance, if the input specifies a quantity of three name tags, the program will process and calculate the cost for three individual name tags. Unlike the previous version, where only rectangular (quadrilateral) name tags were accepted, the new program accommodates two different shapes: rectangular and triangular. Dek Depe aims to alleviate monotony by offering name tags in these two distinct shapes.

The program prompts the user to input the quantity of name tags desired and gathers additional information for each name tag, including its shape and dimensions. Subsequently, the program calculates and displays the total cost for producing the specified number of name tags. The input is guaranteed to be valid, with positive integers provided for both the quantity and dimensions. Notably, the cost for each square centimeter of the name tag remains consistent at 100 rupiahs, regardless of its shape.

In response to decreased business following a beta update, Dek Depe's printing venture faced stiff competition from Dek Penol, who offered lower prices. To level the playing field, Dek Depe aims to update their system to v1.0, like Dek Penol's. This entails accommodating circular name tags via dedicated functions and allowing input for multiple customers' tag orders in a single run.

The program requirements involve gathering input for customer counts and tag quantities, allowing shapes like rectangles, triangles, and circles. Vital area-calculation functions are a must. The updated system caters to multiple customers' orders in one go, eliminating re-runs. The program concludes by printing paper costs for selected tags, with all inputs guaranteed valid.

Dek Penol, as a competitor to Dek Depe, recently upgraded its system to version v1.5, introducing circle shapes and expanding the range of shapes to include n-squares. Motivated by this, Dek Depe decided to make a final update to his printing system to version v2.0. 

Unlike Dek Penol's focus on shapes, Dek Depe aimed to enhance functionality. His update included continuous system operation until manually stopped, displaying customer name tag orders through a queue number mechanism, offering various paper material options with corresponding pricing and quality, and ensuring all area and price calculations displayed only two decimal places. Dek Depe anticipates that this update will strengthen his business and outperform Dek Penol's printing business. In his quest for dominance, he seeks assistance from his trusted IT team member to implement these changes.
