DDP-0 (Fundamentals of Programming 0) is an initiative by the [Faculty of Computer Science UI 2022](https://www.instagram.com/anak_apollo/) aimed specifically at new students of the Faculty of Computer Science UI 2023 who are eager to learn the basic concepts and principles of programming. The follwings are the problems from the program.

## Lab00 0Ô∏è‚É£
I am asked to help Dek Depe, a new student at Faculty of CompSci UI, create a Python program to generate customizable name tags. The program should be able to take input data and sizes for the name tags and calculate the printing costs based on the provided paper cost of Rp100/cm^2.

## Lab01 1Ô∏è‚É£
In the updated version of the Python program for Dek Depe, it now processes multiple name tags based on the input quantity. For instance, if the input specifies a quantity of three name tags, the program will process and calculate the cost for three individual name tags. Unlike the previous version, where only rectangular (quadrilateral) name tags were accepted, the new program accommodates two different shapes: rectangular and triangular. Dek Depe aims to alleviate monotony by offering name tags in these two distinct shapes.

The program prompts the user to input the quantity of name tags desired and gathers additional information for each name tag, including its shape and dimensions. Subsequently, the program calculates and displays the total cost for producing the specified number of name tags. The input is guaranteed to be valid, with positive integers provided for both the quantity and dimensions. Notably, the cost for each square centimeter of the name tag remains consistent at 100 rupiahs, regardless of its shape.
